Multi-platform build system for building ceres from scratch.
Works on:                   Dependencies
    Linux                   BLAS, LAPACK
    Windows (partly)        Git
    Mac OSX (untested)      BLAS, LAPACK

Using the following open source projects:
    eigen:                          http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/
    Metis:                          http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/changes
    SuiteSparse:                    http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse/
    suitesparse-metis-for-windows:  https://github.com/jlblancoc/suitesparse-metis-for-windows
    Ceres:                          https://code.google.com/p/ceres-solver/
    
On windows you need to have Git for Windows installed because patch is needed for this build system. The script will search for the Git patch command in C:/Program Files/Git/bin and C:/Program Files(x86)/Git/bin . If you have installed Git anywhere else or want to use another patch command, please make MP_PATCH in cmake point to that patch command.
